# Entry Exit Monitoring System
This system is to monitor entry and exit in confined space using UHF RFID. The main controller for this project is Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.
But this can be replicated on any Raspberry Pi.
The eemsV3 is specifically made to interface with HR11 RFID Readers

## Getting Started
The project is spanning across one main folder `xaees/` it has the source code for the project. There is a oneliner `install.sh` script which will automatically setup the system. For generating the documentation of the project I have used `mkdocs` and the documentation can be opened using
```sh
$ pip install mkdocs
$ mkdocs serve
```
### Installation
For installing just run the following command
```sh
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hixaa/eemsV2/main/install.sh | bash
```
For more details on setting up the documentation refer [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/)

Once the documentation is up and running you can visit the Getting Started page.
